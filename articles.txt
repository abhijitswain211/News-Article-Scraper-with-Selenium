"Act Without Delay": Thadou Tribe Seeks Action Against Kuki Insurgents In Assam, Writes To Chief Minister
Members of the Thadou tribe held a protest in Assam's Guwahati on Wednesday seeking justice for Thadou leader Nehkam Jomhao, who was tortured and killed by Kuki insurgents in Karbi Anglong last month. While the Kuki Revolutionary Army (KRA) admitted five of its insurgents were involved in the murder of the 59-year-old Thadou leader, it said they acted on their own without the knowledge of the organisation. The KRA Assam agreed to help in the police investigation.
